# Dekan Capital ü¶ç

Dekan Capital is a project focused on effective capital allocation. The Dekan token is a governance vault token and is backed by GHO, a stable yield-enabled token, that supports this initiative. The project offers two primary avenues for capital allocation.

Firstly, it provides a mechanism for anyone, be it individuals, entities, or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), to create governance-gated capital allocation. In this setup, participants can use the Dekan token for voting, allocation, and distribution of funds. Dekan Capital infra facilitates these processes, allowing for seamless collaboration and enabling decision-making beyond single DAOs.

Secondly, the project generates yields through a passive investment strategy known as Proof of Optimistic Future. This strategy focuses on investing funds exclusively in real projects and individuals with a proven track record of achieving profitable exits. It's important to note that the Proof of Optimistic Future strategy is currently in the early stages of development, categorized as Technology Readiness Level 1 (TRL 1).

In summary, Dekan Capital aims to make capital allocation accessible and rewarding for a diverse range of participants. The governance-gated funds are not limited to DAOs, providing an inclusive platform where individuals and various entities can collaborate, make informed decisions through voting, and efficiently manage the deployment of funds using the Dekan token. Holding Dekans not only grants governance rights but also presents an opportunity for passive returns through a selective and thoughtful investment approach.
